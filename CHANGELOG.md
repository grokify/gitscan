### Highlights

- New `order` subcommand for topological dependency ordering
- Time-based filtering with `-since` flag
- Parallel scanning with 50% faster performance

### Added

- New `order` subcommand to show repos in dependency order (update dependencies first) ([`104f2a2`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/104f2a2))
- Topological sort using Kahn's algorithm for dependency-aware ordering ([`7f8ff17`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/7f8ff17))
- Time-based filtering with `-since` flag supporting `7d`, `2w`, `1m` duration formats ([`33af0ef`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/33af0ef))
- Transitive dependency tracking with `-t` flag to include repos that depend on modified repos ([`7f8ff17`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/7f8ff17))
- Unpushed commit detection with `-u` flag to filter repos needing push ([`7f8ff17`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/7f8ff17))

### Changed

- Migrated CLI from standard `flag` package to Cobra for better UX ([`33af0ef`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/33af0ef))
- Added short flags: `-d` (dir), `-f` (format), `-r` (recurse), `-s` (since) ([`33af0ef`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/33af0ef))
- Output now shows numbered list with alphabetical sorting ([`33af0ef`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/33af0ef))
- Refactored scanner package with `ScanOptions` for configurable behavior ([`7f8ff17`](https://github.com/grokify/gitscan/commit/7f8ff17))

### Performance
